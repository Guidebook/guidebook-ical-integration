SUMMARY:D&D Adventurer's League -  Durlag's Tower (T3)
DESCRIPTION:East of Beregost, nestled in the outskirts of the Wood of Sharp Teeth, Durlag's Tower has intrigued and yet stymied adventurers for decades. Stuffed full of mechanical traps and arcane wards, and rumored to be inhabited by fiends, very few have managed to extract any REAL treasure from the former home of Durlag Trollkiller.  However, a powerful item in the ancient fight against the giants is said to be housed there, and the cloud giant Baron Rajiram has committed significant resources toward recovering it. After a pleasant tea in her garden, SEER calls upon you to beat him there and put a stop to his efforts!  D&D AL Module DDAL05-08. A Tier 3 event (levels 11-16). 4 hour adventure. Multiple sessions available. Registration opens at 10AM on Friday, Nov 17th, at PAX RPG HQ.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Creating and enforcing codes of conduct for gaming communities, whether at conventions, game nights, campaigns, or online is both difficult and draining. Often we are too tolerant of bad behaviors because of trying not to bully or exclude--something many were victims of in the past. The panelists will discuss what makes a good code of conduct and the perils and stresses of enforcing it. Being the bad guy to one or a few is being the good guy to many, but that doesn't make it easier.\n\nPanelists Include: Maury Brown [President, game designer, Learn Larp, LLC], Ben Morrow [VP, Learn Larp, LLC], Tanya DePass [Director & Founder, I Need Diverse Games]
